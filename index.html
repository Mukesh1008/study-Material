    <!-- Chosen Palette: Dark Midnight -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as a one-page scroller with a sticky navigation bar for quick access to key study areas. The structure is thematic, mirroring the first two chapters of the syllabus: 1) Introduction to Big Data, and 2) Hadoop Fundamentals. This non-linear, task-oriented structure allows a student to jump directly to a weak area, maximizing last-minute study efficiency. The interactive elements (expandable details for questions with a new short/long answer toggle) are chosen to break down complex information and provide immediate feedback, aiding rapid learning. A new JavaScript function ensures only one question is open at a time for better focus. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - The 5Vs of Big Data: Report Info -> Characteristics of Big Data -> Goal: Organize -> Viz/Method: HTML/CSS list with Unicode icons -> Interaction: None -> Justification: A simple list with icons is the most effective way to present these key characteristics for easy memorization.
        - Questions & Answers: Report Info -> Key exam topics -> Goal: Review -> Viz/Method: Expandable questions using <details> tags -> Interaction: User clicks to reveal answers. A toggle switch allows the user to change the level of detail from short to long. -> Justification: This pattern efficiently hides answers for active recall, and the new toggle feature provides both quick review and in-depth study material in a single, clean interface.

                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Big Data</strong> refers to extremely large and complex datasets that cannot be managed or processed by traditional database systems. The three main characteristics are:</p>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
                                <li><strong>Volume:</strong> The huge amount of data being generated every second.</li>
                                <li><strong>Velocity:</strong> The high speed at which data is created, collected, and needs to be processed.</li>
                                <li><strong>Variety:</strong> The different types of data, from structured (like a database) to unstructured (like photos, videos, or text).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Big Data</strong> is a term for data that is so large and complex that traditional data processing software is unable to deal with it. The key challenge is not just the size, but the combination of its various characteristics, often referred to as the 5Vs:</p>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3">
                                <li><strong>Volume:</strong> This is the most obvious characteristic. It refers to the massive amount of data being generated constantly. For example, a single jet engine can generate 10 terabytes of data in just 30 minutes of flight.</li>
                                <li><strong>Velocity:</strong> This refers to the speed at which data is created and needs to be processed. Real-time analysis of data from sources like IoT sensors or financial markets is critical for quick decision-making.</li>
                                <li><strong>Variety:</strong> This includes the different types of data that exist. Data can be structured (like in a spreadsheet), unstructured (like an image or video), or semi-structured (like a JSON file).</li>
                                <li><strong>Veracity:</strong> This refers to the quality and trustworthiness of the data. Because data comes from many different sources, it can be messy, noisy, and unreliable. Veracity is about making sure the data is accurate enough to be useful.</li>
                                <li><strong>Value:</strong> This is the most important V. It refers to the potential benefit or insight that can be gained from analyzing the data. Without value, the other Vs are meaningless.</li>

                            <p class="mb-2">Traditional systems (like a single SQL database) were built for a smaller amount of structured data. They cannot handle the huge volume, fast speed, and different types of data that make up Big Data. They are not designed to scale easily across many computers.</p>

                            <p class="mb-4">Traditional database systems, such as relational databases (RDBMS), were designed for a different era of data and have several key limitations when dealing with Big Data:</p>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3">
                                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Traditional databases are designed to "scale up," which means adding more power (CPU, RAM) to a single machine. This is very expensive and has a physical limit. Big Data requires "scaling out" across many low-cost machines.</li>
                                <li><strong>Schema Rigidity:</strong> RDBMS require a fixed schema, meaning the data must fit into a predefined table structure. This is not suitable for the "Variety" of data, especially unstructured data like images and text.</li>
                                <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Processing petabytes of data on a single machine is extremely slow. Traditional databases are not built for parallel processing across a cluster.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cost:</strong> High-end servers and storage solutions required for traditional databases are very expensive, making them impractical for the massive storage needs of Big Data.</li>
                                <li><strong>Fault Tolerance:</strong> If the single server of a traditional database fails, the entire system goes down. Big Data systems are designed to be fault-tolerant, where the failure of one node does not stop the entire system.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li><strong>Structured Data:</strong> This is data that is highly organized with a fixed schema. It is easy to search and analyze using standard tools like SQL. Examples include data in relational databases, financial records, and sensor data from IoT devices.</li>
                                <li><strong>Unstructured Data:</strong> This data has no predefined format or organization. It accounts for a huge portion of the world's data and is much harder to process. Examples include email bodies, social media posts, audio recordings, video files, images, and text documents.</li>
                                <li><strong>Semi-structured Data:</strong> This is a middle ground. It does not have a formal table structure but has organizational properties that make it easier to analyze than unstructured data. Examples include JSON and XML files.</li>

                                <li><strong>Inconsistency:</strong> Data from different sources may not be consistent. For example, a customer's name might be spelled differently in a sales database than in a support database.</li>

                                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> DFS can easily be scaled by adding more nodes to the cluster, increasing both storage capacity and performance.</li>
                                <li><strong>Parallel Processing:</strong> Since the data is distributed, it can be processed in parallel by different machines, drastically reducing the time it takes to analyze large datasets.</li>

                            <p class="mb-2">HDFS is a file system designed to store very large files across many machines in a cluster. It splits large files into smaller blocks and stores these blocks on different computers. It also makes copies of each block for fault tolerance, so if one machine fails, the data is not lost.</p>

                            <p class="mb-4">HDFS is a file system designed to handle Big Data in a distributed manner. Its basic idea revolves around the following concepts:</p>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3">
                                <li><strong>Block Size:</strong> Unlike traditional file systems that use small block sizes (e.g., 4KB), HDFS uses a very large block size (e.g., 128MB or 256MB) to minimize the overhead of seeking for data, making it efficient for sequential reads.</li>
                                <li><strong>Master/Slave Architecture:</strong> HDFS works on a master/slave model. The **Namenode** is the master that manages the filesystem's metadata, and the **Datanodes** are the slaves that store the actual data blocks.</li>
                                <li><strong>Replication:</strong> For fault tolerance, HDFS makes multiple copies of each data block and stores them on different Datanodes. The default replication factor is three, meaning each block is stored on three different machines.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This design allows HDFS to store petabytes of data reliably and allows processing frameworks like MapReduce to run their computations close to the data.</p>

                            <p class="mb-2">Fault tolerance means the system can continue to work even if some parts fail. HDFS achieves this by making multiple copies (usually three) of each data block and storing them on different Datanodes. If one Datanode fails, the data can be recovered from the other copies.</p>

                            <p class="mb-4">Hadoop is designed to be highly fault-tolerant because it assumes that hardware will fail. HDFS achieves this fault tolerance through **data replication** and an intelligent self-healing mechanism:</p>

                                <li><strong>Data Replication:</strong> When a file is written to HDFS, it is split into blocks. By default, each block is replicated three times and stored on three different Datanodes. The Namenode tracks the location of all these replicas.</li>
                                <li><strong>Failure Detection:</strong> The Namenode continuously monitors the Datanodes via "heartbeat" messages. If a Datanode stops sending heartbeats, the Namenode assumes it has failed.</li>
                                <li><strong>Self-Healing:</strong> When a Datanode fails, the Namenode automatically detects that the replication factor for the blocks on that Datanode has fallen below the desired level. It then instructs other Datanodes to make new copies of those blocks, restoring the replication factor and ensuring the data is safe.</li>

                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3">
                                <li><strong>Scale-Out (Hadoop):</strong> To increase storage and processing capacity, you simply add more computers (Datanodes) to the cluster. The system is designed to handle this seamlessly, and performance increases almost linearly with the number of machines. This uses commodity hardware, which is much cheaper.</li>
                                <li><strong>Scale-Up (Traditional):</strong> To increase capacity, you must upgrade to a more powerful, more expensive single machine. This approach has a physical limit and is not sustainable for Big Data.</li>

                            <p class="mb-2">A combiner is an optional function that runs on the mapper machine after the Map phase.

It is an optional class that is essentially a mini-reducer that runs on the same machine as the mapper.

                                <li><strong>Local Aggregation:</strong> The combiner aggregates the intermediate key-value pairs produced by a single mapper task. For example, if a mapper finds the word "the" 100 times, it will output `(the, 100)` instead of 100 separate `(the, 1)` pairs.</li>
                                <li><strong>When to Use:</strong> A combiner can only be used if the reduce function is **commutative** and **associative**. This means the order of aggregation doesn't matter (e.g., addition and multiplication). The combiner's output can then be safely passed to the reducer without affecting the final result.</li>

                            <p class="mb-2">The main drawback is its complexity. Writing MapReduce jobs can be difficult and time-consuming. It is also not well-suited for interactive, real-time queries or for jobs that require multiple, chained steps.</p>

                                <li><strong>Complexity of Programming:</strong> Writing a MapReduce job is difficult and requires a lot of boilerplate code. Even simple tasks like joining two datasets can be complex to program.</li>
                                <li><strong>Performance for Multi-Step Jobs:</strong> For jobs that require multiple MapReduce stages, the output of one job must be written to disk before the next job can read it. This heavy disk I/O and network traffic make it slow for iterative algorithms.</li>
                                <li><strong>Poor for Interactive Queries:</strong> MapReduce is not suitable for quick, real-time queries because of the high overhead of starting a new job.</li>
                                <li><strong>Inflexible Model:</strong> The strict Map/Reduce model does not fit all types of data processing tasks, especially those that are iterative or require a more complex workflow.</li>

                            <p class="mb-2">Data locality is the principle of moving the computation to the data, rather than the other way around. In Hadoop, the MapReduce framework tries to run a mapper task on the same machine where the data block is stored. This reduces network traffic and makes the job run much faster.</p>

                            <p class="mb-4">Data locality is one of the most important concepts for achieving high performance in Hadoop. It is the principle that it is much cheaper and faster to move a small amount of code (computation) to a large amount of data than to move a large amount of data to a small amount of code. This is because network bandwidth is often a major bottleneck in Big Data systems. The Hadoop framework tries to achieve this by:</p>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3">
                                <li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> The scheduler (YARN) tries to schedule a Map task on a machine that already has a copy of the data block that the task needs to process.</li>
                                <li><strong>Block Replication:</strong> Because data blocks are replicated across multiple Datanodes, there is a high probability that there will be a copy of the required data on a machine that has idle processing power.</li>

                            <p>By maximizing data locality, Hadoop can significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network, leading to much faster job completion times.</p>

                                <li><strong>Job:</strong> A job is the overall unit of work that is submitted by the user to the MapReduce framework. It represents a complete program, for example, a program to count words in a billion-line text file.</li>
                                <li><strong>Task:</strong> A task is a smaller unit of work that makes up a job. A single MapReduce job is made up of many Map tasks and many Reduce tasks. Each Map task processes a single InputSplit, and each Reduce task processes the data for a specific set of keys. The framework's job is to manage the execution and coordination of all these tasks.</li>

                                <li><strong>Commodity Hardware:</strong> Hadoop is designed to run on a cluster of inexpensive, off-the-shelf servers.

                                <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> The entire Hadoop framework is open-source, which means there are no expensive licensing fees. This eliminates a huge cost barrier for organizations that want to start working with Big Data.</li>
                                <li><strong>Linear Scalability:</strong> The ability to scale by adding more low-cost machines means organizations can start small and only pay for the capacity they need as their data grows, avoiding large upfront investments.</li>
